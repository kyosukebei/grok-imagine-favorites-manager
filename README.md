## Technical Details & Credits

### Recent Improvements

Special thanks to **[masamunet](https://github.com/masamunet)** for significant core contributions:

* **"Universal Sweep" Logic:** Overhauled the unfavorite system to fix issues where video items were skipped. The logic now uses a two-pronged approach: a physical click on the "Unsave" button followed by a sequential API backup for 100% reliability.
* **Deep ID Extraction:** Implemented `findAllUUIDsInElement` to scan all attributes for Post IDs. This ensures the original Post ID is captured even when the video UUID differs (common with regenerated videos).
* **Sequential Processing:** Shifted from "batch" processing to an `await` flow to prevent race conditions and ensure every item is processed before moving to the next.
* **Reliable High-Quality Downloads:** Fixed logic to ensure "Images Only" and "Videos Only" filters work strictly as intended without mixed content, while always grabbing the highest resolution available.

### System details

- Downloads are rate-limited to approximately 3 per second to avoid browser issues
- Unfavorite requests are delayed by 150ms between calls
- Upscale requests are staggered with 300ms delays and run in parallel
- Progress tracking displays in an on-screen modal with visual progress bar
- Content script automatically scrolls to load all lazy-loaded content

## Important Notes

- **⚠️ Grok Imagine is constantly changing** - This extension may break with platform updates
- The extension works on https://grok.com/imagine/favorites
- No manual scrolling needed - the extension handles it automatically
- Video filenames automatically match their corresponding image names for easy pairing
- **Only the most recently generated video is processed** - Earlier video versions are not accessible
- Keep the tab open while operations run to ensure completion
- Progress is shown in an on-screen modal with cancellation option
- Unfavorite operations work by calling `/rest/media/post/unlike` with the post id
- Upscale requests are sent to `/rest/media/video/upscale` and complete in the background

## Support

This extension is designed specifically for Grok Imagine favorites management. **The Grok platform is actively developed and frequently changes.** If features stop working, the extension will need updates to match new DOM structures, API endpoints, or workflows. Check the repository for updates or open an issue if you encounter problems.
